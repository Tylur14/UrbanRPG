A Single Tiny Favor (Quest Notes)

This is a parody of the Runescape quest "One Small Favour".
One of the purposes of this quest is to give the player an axe and way to purchase axes.

NPC's Needed: 8
NPC's Made:
1.) Yanni Yonson, RuneScape / JonTron
2.) Captain Shark, RuneScape
3.) Brian Thompson, RuneScape
4.) Tassie Thompson
5.) Bailif
5.) Tassie Slipcall, RuneScape
6.)	Hunter Groats
7.) Fred

Start Quest: 

Yanni Yonson wants Red Mahogany Logs x 1

Captain Shark wants you to get Blunt Axe sharpened

NPC Brian Thompson wants you to check on his sister at the police station

Tassie Thompson wants you to pay her bail. He promises she'll pay you back ;)

NPC E (Bailif) won't accept the bail until you get his Bailing Book back

The Bailing Book is with the rats in the Rattaway

You talk to the rat and they reveal they accidentally locked it in a safe.

You have to then buy a lockpick (or already have one) and pick the safe

There is an IOU that reveals Yanni Yonson has the Bailing Book

Yanni Yonson wants a specific refreshing drink in exchange for the book noting *It's a good deal since normally it'd cost a lot more if the player wasn't helping Yanni to begin with*

Fred (drink vendor) reveals that flavor is discontinued but there is one bottle left.

Fred wants some mushy shrooms from the park.

Finally the player can work backwards delivering every item.
